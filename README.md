# General information about GenCou

*Authors:* Julius Unverfehrt, Jan Stanicki, Michael Zadikowitsch, Oliver Zobel

The gencou project revolves around generating counter arguments.
Given an argument, locate relevant data in a preconstructed argument knowledge graph
and generate the "best" counterargument using a Seq2Seq model to transform the
vertices and edges into natural language.

The project was created for the course 'Softwareprojekt' during our bachelor
in the Institute of Computational Linguistics Heidelberg and was supervised
by Prof. Dr. Annette Frank. The course spanned from October 22nd 2019 to February 29th 2020.
